# Melon

Melon is an audio recorder and my attempt to make a self-hostable Google Recorder.

## Why?

A few reasons:
1. I use Google Recorder a lot and in two ways. I record my young kids talk shite and i record myself playing guitar when i feel like i have an interesting chord progression or song idea or something.
2. I'm a web dev and i use AI a lot now in work and also in personal projects. It kinda takes the joy out of programming so i intend to build this project without any agentic AI, im thinking auto-complete like supermaven will still be used as at least my intent is still there.
3. I want to run this off my unraid machine.
